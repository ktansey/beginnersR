# FIRST

We need to alter how the output is displayed for this R markdown file. We want the output to be displayed in the console **NOT** within the R markdown file.      

To change this:

    Click on the Gear Icon > Select "Chunk Output in Console"

# Reveal the Table of Contents 

This practical has a table of contents created using the **#**. Creating headers in Markdown will automatically created a Table of Contents.      

To access this: press the dashed line button on the upper right corner of the markdown file.

# Examine the gapminder data

Let's first get a dataset to work on. Install and load the gapminder package in R. 

Access gapminder data by:
```{r, eval = FALSE}
# remember you only have to install a package once
install.packages("gapminder")
library(gapminder)
head(gapminder)
```

1. How many rows and columns are there?

```{r}

```

2. What do the first few rows look like?

```{r}

```

3. Does it have column names? What are they?

```{r}

```

4. What type of data is in each column?

```{r}

```

5. Examine the output from summary. What is this telling you about the data?

```{r}

```


# select          

Using the gapminder dataset:    

1. Select country, year, and population columns from gapminder             

```{r}

```

Using the iris dataset :    

2. Select all columns that contain the word Length      
There are numerous ways to do this -- how many different ways can you find?

```{r}

```

3. Select all columns that contain the word Petal       
There are numerous ways to do this -- how many different ways can you find?

```{r}

```

Using the mtcars dataset:         

4. Select all columns but disp and hp

```{r}

```

5. Select columns mpg through to qsec, and gear

```{r}

```


# filter         

Using the gapminder dataset:      

1. Keep only those rows with a life expectancy under 35    

```{r}

```      

2. Keep only rows where continent is Americas or Europe.   
Strings (characters/words) must be surround in quotes.    

```{r}

```

3. Keep only rows where country is Canada and the year is greater than 1983    

```{r}

```  

4. Keep only rows where country is Canada or Australia and the year is before 1974  
    
```{r}

```  

5. Keep only the rows where the year is greater than 1990, the continent is Europe and the gdpPercap is greater than 35000        

```{r}

``` 

# arrange 

Using the gapminder dataset:

1. Arrange the gapminder data by ascending year

```{r}

```

2. Arrange the gapminder data by descending year

```{r}

```

3. Arrange the gapminder data by descending country and ascending year

```{r}

```

# group

Using the msleep dataset:
    msleep is a mammals sleep dataset
    
1. Examine the first few lines of the msleep dataset     

```{r}

```

2. Group by vore      

```{r}

```

3. Group by order     

```{r}

```

4. Group by vore and order    

```{r}

```

*Does the output look different between the different datasets?*          

# summarise


Using the gapminder dataset:

1. Get the standard deviation (sd) for the population column

```{r}

```

2. Get the median and standard deviation for gdpPercap

```{r}

```

3. Get the minimum and maxiumum life expectancy. 

```{r}

```

Using the msleep dataset:

4. Get the mean for sleep_total and awake     

```{r}

```

5. Get the maximum and minimum brainwt     

```{r}

```


*NOTE:* output is in table format, which can be saved as data frame. 

# mutate

Using the gapminder dataset:

1. Create a column called GDP which is population multiplied by gdpPercap

```{r}

```

Using the iris dataset:       

2. Create two columns, one for sepal area (sepal width times sepal length) and petal area (petal width times petal length)

```{r}

```

# pipe

Using the gapminder dataset:

1. Keep only the rows where year is 1982 and sort by descending gdpPercap

```{r}

```

2. Keep only the rows where country is Canada, select only the country, year and pop columns, and then ascending sort by population

```{r}

```

3. Keep only the rows where year is 1982 and the continent is Europe and sort by descending lifeExp, and then only return country and lifeExp columns    

```{r}

```

4. Sort the data by the minimum life expectancy for each country      
Need to find the minimum life expectancy for each country (*HINT*: group_by and then summarise).      

```{r}

```

5. Get the average life expectancy by country and year, and sorted for the longest life expectancy.   

```{r}

```

6. For just countries in Africa, create a new variable called GDP which is population multiplied by gdpPercap, then get the average GDP by year and country and sort this be descending GDP      

```{r}

```

**Challenge**     
7. How many distinct countries are in the file for each continent?        
*HINT:* Use [n_distinct](http://dplyr.tidyverse.org/reference/n_distinct.html)

```{r}

```

**BIG challenge**     
8. Sort countries by their change in GDP from 1952 to 2007.      
*HINT:* These other dplyr commands may help [lead and lag](https://rdrr.io/cran/dplyr/man/lead-lag.html) and [n](https://www.rdocumentation.org/packages/dplyr/versions/0.5.0/topics/n).  

```{r}

```

# Reshape data     

1. From the data folder, load pew.txt into R and save it as a variable called "pew"     

Do this either using the import functionality or by writing out the code.      

```{r}

```

2. Examine pew    

```{r}

```

**What format is the data in?**     

3. Change the format of pew to have three columns only, one for religion, one for income bracket and one for the number of individuals in that income bracket. Save as a new data frame called *pew_long*      
*REMINDER* the code format looks like this:      
```{r, eval = FALSE}
gather(data, key, value, columns_info)
```     

```{r}

```

4. Reshape *pew_long* to back to wide format, and save as a new data frame called *pew_wide*. 
*REMINDER* the code format looks like this:          
```{r, eval = FALSE}
spread(data, key, value)
```     

```{r}

```

The data should look like the original data now. *Does it?*

# Reshape take 2

1. From the data folder, load tb.csv into R and save it as a variable called "tb".     

Do this either using the import functionality or by writing out the code.      

```{r}

```

2. Examine tb    

```{r}

```

3. Change the format of tb to have four columns only: iso2, year, group, values. Save as a new data frame called *tb_long*

```{r}

```

Is there a way we could remove the excess NAs?      
How could I find out more about the options for the gather command?     
Where would I go for help or more information about my command?     

4. Remake tb_long but this time remove the excess NAs   

```{r}

```

5. Reshape *tb_long* to back to wide format, and save as a new data frame called *tb_wide*. 
 
```{r}

```


# Missing Data

1. Examine the built-in dataset called airquality (head and dim the dataset)    
```{r}

```

2. How many rows are missing at least 1 variable?     
```{r}

```

3. Remove all rows with missing data, save the new clean dataset as airquality_nomissing       
```{r}

```   

## Missing and Utilities   
```{r}
summarise(airquality, mean_ozone = mean(Ozone))
```
**Why is this result occuring? What does the documentation about mean tell you?**   

To correct of this, the default needs to be over ridden.       
How would you do this?     
```{r}

```

 
# Play with joins

We are going to work with the some data from Harry Potter. 

1. From the data folder, load in all the dataset that start with HP (there should be 4). 

```{r}

```

2. Examine each HP data.    

```{r}

```

3. Merge together HP_books and HP_houses, keeping only the rows from HP_books.      
What are your keys?

```{r}

```

What do you think the error message means?     
Should we be concerned?      

4. What happens if we do not tell the command which columns to join on?      

```{r}

```

5. What is the difference between doing a left_join between HP_books and HP_houses, and doing a right_join?      

```{r}

```

6. Join together HP_deaths and HP_houses, keeping only the rows common to both data sets.      

```{r}

```

7. Join together HP_actors and HP_houses, keep all the rows from both data sets.    

```{r}

```

Did you get an error? If so, why?      

If you successfully merged, do you see any type of order in the merge?
